# FPGA_AdaptiveTrafficLightSystem
**Hierarchical Traffic Light Controller**   Designed in SystemVerilog, this project uses an FSM to model a traffic light system and a parameterized, hierarchical down counter for a timer module. It ensures precise 7.5-second Amber light duration and seamless integration between traffic logic and timing control. Scalable and modular.
