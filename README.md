# FPGA Adaptive Traffic Light System

This project implements an **Adaptive Traffic Light System** using FPGA, designed in **SystemVerilog**. It leverages a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** to model the traffic light logic and a parameterized, hierarchical down counter for precise timing control. The system ensures a **7.5-seconds amber light duration** and seamless integration between the traffic logic and timing control.

## Key Features:
- **Finite State Machine (FSM)** for traffic light logic.
- **Parameterized Down Counter** for accurate time management.
- Scalable and modular design for easy extension.

## Learning Outcomes:
This project was part of the **Fundamentals of Digital System Design** course conducted by **Skill Surf**, a learning foundation formed by Electronics and Telecommunication postgraduates and lecturers, supervised by **Dr. Subodha Charles**.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- **SystemVerilog HDL** for FPGA design.
- **FPGA Synthesis and Analysis** using **Quartus Prime**.
- Understanding how an **FPGA board** works, **FPGA-based designs** function, and integrate with hardware.
## Tools Used:
- **SystemVerilog** for design and implementation.
- **Quartus Prime** for synthesis and analysis.
- **FPGA Development Board** for hardware implementation.
